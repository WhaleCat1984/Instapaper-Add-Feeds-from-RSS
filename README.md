# RSS-To-Instapaper
I recently found an app which i actually really like. The app is called "Instapaper" within you're able to manage your favorite web articles and read them like a newspaper with as less fancy things around them as possible.

I've noticed that there is no option to import articles from a RSS feed to your Instapaper Account so i decided to take this idea and start coding a small ruby script to get the thing done. I've never done anything more than toying around with ruby, so this is actually my first viable ruby script.

Thats why this is a prototype which i coded this evening.  - i would like to add some more features this year, for example assigning the articles to your personal folders, adding descriptions, ...

If you want to import articles from any rss you like, i hope you enjoy this little script.



Run
---

    ruby rsstoinsta.rb "https://yourfavoriterss.com/feed" "username" "password"


execute the rubyscript with the following parameters: uri to your RSS, Instapaper Username, Instapaper Password
