# RSS-To-Instapaper
I recently found an app which i actually really like. The app is called "Instapaper" within you're able to manage your favorite web articles and read them like a newspaper with as less fancy things around them. I've noticed that there is no option to import articles from an RSS feed so i decided to code a small ruby script.
