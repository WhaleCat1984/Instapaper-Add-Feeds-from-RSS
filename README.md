# Instapaper - Add Feeds from RSS
With this little Ruby script it is possible to transfer articles from an RSS feed to your Instapaper account. I noticed that there is no way to do this within the app, so I wrote this simple script.
I've never done anything more than toying around with ruby, so this was actually really fun.
